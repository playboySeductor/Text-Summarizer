This study included 16 young female patients with vasovagal syncope and 12 age matched female controls . The subjects were enrolled in a head up tilt test breathing normally including 5min of baseline and 18min of 70 orthostatic phase . To increase the time resolution of the analysis the time series were segmented in five minute overlapping windows with a shift of 1min . Hemodynamic parameters did not show any statistical differences between SYN and CON . Time domain linear analysis revealed increased respiratory frequency and increased blood pressure variability in patients during OP meaning increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal . Frequency domain analysis confirmed a predominance of sympathetic tone by steadily increased values of low over high frequency power in BBI and of low frequency power in SYS and DIA in patients during OP . The nonlinear analysis by symbolic dynamics seemed to be highly suitable for differentiation of SYN and CON in the early beginning of OP i.e . 5min after tilt up . In particular the index SYS plvar3 showed less patterns of low variability in patients reflecting a steadily increase in both BPV and sympathetic activity .
